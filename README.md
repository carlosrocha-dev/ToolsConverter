# Currency and Temperature Conversion Tool

This project aims to create a currency and temperature conversion tool using the Java programming language. The tool is designed to meet the specific requirements outlined by our client. The primary features of the tool include currency conversion between different currencies and the ability to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Features

### Currency Converter

The currency converter component allows users to convert between the Brazilian Real (BRL) and several other major currencies. The supported currency conversion pairs are:

- Brazilian Real (BRL) to US Dollar (USD)
- Brazilian Real (BRL) to Euro (EUR)
- Brazilian Real (BRL) to British Pound (GBP)
- Brazilian Real (BRL) to Argentine Peso (ARS)
- Brazilian Real (BRL) to Chilean Peso (CLP)

Additionally, the tool also supports reverse currency conversions:

- US Dollar (USD) to Brazilian Real (BRL)
- Euro (EUR) to Brazilian Real (BRL)
- British Pound (GBP) to Brazilian Real (BRL)
- Argentine Peso (ARS) to Brazilian Real (BRL)
- Chilean Peso (CLP) to Brazilian Real (BRL)

### Temperature Converter

The temperature converter component allows users to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales. Users can input a temperature value in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and instantly receive the converted value in the alternate scale.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-temperature-conversion.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd currency-temperature-conversion`
4. Compile the Java source files: `javac Main.java`
5. Run the application: `java Main`

## Usage

1. Select the desired conversion mode: currency or temperature.
2. For currency conversion, choose the source and target currencies from the available options.
3. Enter the amount you want to convert.
4. The converted amount will be displayed.

For temperature conversion:

1. Choose the temperature scale you have (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
2. Enter the temperature value.
3. The converted temperature in the other scale will be displayed.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate real-time currency exchange rates using an API.
- Add support for more currencies in the currency converter.
- Improve the user interface for better usability.
- Implement additional temperature scales beyond Celsius and Fahrenheit.
